<h1>Python Algorithm Challenges</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project contains a collection of Python algorithms implemented as part of the learning process during my time as a student at Trybe. Each algorithm focuses on a different problem and showcases various programming concepts and techniques.</p>

<p>The algorithms included in this project are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Number of students studying at the same time (Search Algorithm)</li>
  <li>Inversion Encryption (Test-Driven Development)</li>
  <li>Palindromes (Recursion)</li>
  <li>Anagrams (Sorting Algorithm)</li>
  <li>Finding Duplicate Numbers (Search Algorithm)</li>
  <li>Palindromes (Iterative Approach)</li>
</ol>

<p>The project provides an opportunity for others to clone and explore the algorithms. It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment for testing and running the project.</p>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation</h2>

<p>To clone the project and set up the virtual environment, follow these steps:</p>

<p>Clone the repository:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:JoeyHetfield/Python_Algorithms.git</code></pre>

<p>Change into the project directory and create a virtual environment:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m venv .venv</code></pre>

<p>Activate the virtual environment:</p>

<pre><code>source .venv/bin/activate</code></pre>

<p>Install the dependencies in the virtual environment:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Running the Tests</h3>

<p>To execute the tests, ensure that you have the virtual environment activated. Run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m pytest</code></pre>

<p>The tests will be run, and the results will be displayed in the console.</p>
